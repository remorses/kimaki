### üë§ User

read the .d.ts for the opencode sdk inside node_modules. see package.json for cli first. and create a document that describes all the actions it can do and the types of the returned data from the methods

### üë§ User

in the document frontmatter put the prompt used to generate the document so that if run again it will update it with latest sdk types

    The document should include:
    - All available methods from OpencodeClient class
    - Parameters required for each method

    - Error handling information
    - Usage examples

```

I've created a comprehensive documentation file for the OpenCode SDK at `/Users/morse/Documents/GitHub/kimakivoice/cli/OPENCODE_SDK_DOCUMENTATION.md` that covers:

- **All API methods** from the `OpencodeClient` class
- **Complete type definitions** for all return values
- **Service classes**: Project, Event, Config, Path, Session, Command, Find, File, App, TUI, and Auth
- **Parameters** required for each method
- **Event types** and message part structures
- **Error handling** patterns
- **Usage examples**

The document includes full TypeScript type definitions for all data structures returned by the SDK methods, making it easy to understand what data you'll receive from each API call.

What model are you currently using?

I don‚Äôt have access to the exact model name. The backend selects the model and I operate within that. If you need specifics, check the platform‚Äôs docs or settings. What would you like me to do next?

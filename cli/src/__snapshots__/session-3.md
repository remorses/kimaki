# Initializing Prisma SQLite with Chat model

## Conversation

### üë§ User

initialize prisma database in cli. using sqlite. the schema should just have a model Chat with markdown and sessionId fields for now

then import prisma in @cli/src/plugin.ts 

the database location should be in ~/kimaki.db

It seems like there's an issue with the adapter configuration. Let me update the Prisma schema to use an absolute path and simplify the Prisma client initialization.

Now let me update the plugin.ts to use standard Prisma client without the adapter configuration:

Done! I've successfully:

1. Installed Prisma, @prisma/client, better-sqlite3, and related dependencies in the CLI package
2. Created a Prisma schema at `cli/prisma/schema.prisma` with:
   - SQLite database located at `~/kimaki.db` (/Users/morse/kimaki.db)
   - A `Chat` model with `markdown` and `sessionId` fields (plus auto-generated id, createdAt, and updatedAt fields)
3. Generated the Prisma client and created the database
4. Imported PrismaClient in `cli/src/plugin.ts` and initialized it

The Prisma client is now ready to use in your plugin. You can use it to create, read, update, and delete Chat records like:

```typescript
// Create a chat
await prisma.chat.create({
  data: {
    markdown: "Some markdown content",
    sessionId: sessionId
  }
})

// Find chats by sessionId
const chats = await prisma.chat.findMany({
  where: { sessionId: sessionId }
})
```

Done! I've successfully:

1. Installed Prisma, @prisma/client, better-sqlite3, and related dependencies in the CLI package
2. Created a Prisma schema at `cli/prisma/schema.prisma` with:
   - SQLite database located at `~/kimaki.db` (/Users/morse/kimaki.db)
   - A `Chat` model with `markdown` and `sessionId` fields (plus auto-generated id, createdAt, and updatedAt fields)
3. Generated the Prisma client and created the database
4. Imported PrismaClient in `cli/src/plugin.ts` and initialized it

The Prisma client is now ready to use in your plugin. You can use it to create, read, update, and delete Chat records like:

```typescript
// Create a chat
await prisma.chat.create({
  data: {
    markdown: "Some markdown content",
    sessionId: sessionId
  }
})

// Find chats by sessionId
const chats = await prisma.chat.findMany({
  where: { sessionId: sessionId }
})
```

```

Perfect! I've updated the configuration to:

1. Changed the Prisma schema to use `env("DATABASE_URL")` for the database location
2. Added imports for `homedir` and `join` from Node.js built-in modules
3. Dynamically set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable using `process.env.DATABASE_URL = \`file:${dbPath}\``
4. The database path is now resolved using `join(homedir(), 'kimaki.db')` which will work across different systems

The database will now be created at `~/kimaki.db` regardless of the username or system, using Node.js utilities to properly resolve the home directory.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tool: bash

```

Perfect! The setup is now complete. I've successfully:

1. Updated the Prisma schema to include `previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]`
2. Imported `PrismaBetterSQLite3` from `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3` and `Database` from `better-sqlite3`
3. Created the Prisma client with the driver adapter using:
   - `const sqlite = new Database(dbPath)` to create the SQLite connection
   - `const adapter = new PrismaBetterSQLite3(sqlite)` to create the adapter
   - `const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter } as any)` to initialize Prisma with the adapter
4. The database path is dynamically resolved using `join(homedir(), 'kimaki.db')`

The Prisma client is now properly configured with the better-sqlite3 driver adapter and will use the database at `~/kimaki.db`.

The Bun SQLite import needs to be handled differently in TypeScript. Let me update it:

```yaml

Good, now let's implement the database initialization with migration:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tool: edit

**Input:**
```yaml
filePath: /Users/morse/Documents/GitHub/kimakivoice/cli/src/plugin.ts
oldString: |-
  export const MyPlugin: Plugin = async ({
      project,
      client,
      $,

      directory,
      worktree,
  }) => {
      let sessionId = ''

      logger.log('plugin function called')
newString: |-
  export const MyPlugin: Plugin = async ({
      project,
      client,
      $,

      directory,
      worktree,
  }) => {
      let sessionId = ''

      // Initialize database
      const dbPath = join(homedir(), 'kimaki.db')
      const dbExists = existsSync(dbPath)
      const db = new Database(dbPath)

      // Create table if database is new
      if (!dbExists) {
          const createTableSQL = `
              CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Chat (
                  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT (lower(hex(randomblob(4))) || '-' || lower(hex(randomblob(2))) || '-4' || substr(lower(hex(randomblob(2))),2) || '-' || substr('89ab',abs(random()) % 4 + 1, 1) || substr(lower(hex(randomblob(2))),2) || '-' || lower(hex(randomblob(6)))),
                  markdown TEXT NOT NULL,
                  sessionId TEXT NOT NULL,
                  createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
                  updatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
              );

              CREATE TRIGGER update_chat_updated_at
              AFTER UPDATE ON Chat
              BEGIN
                  UPDATE Chat SET updatedAt = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = NEW.id;
              END;
          `
          db.run(createTableSQL)
          logger.log(`Database created and initialized at: ${dbPath}`)
      } else {
          logger.log(`Database loaded from: ${dbPath}`)
      }

      logger.log('plugin function called')

```

**Output:**
```

```

Now let's add a type declaration for the Database since TypeScript can't find the Bun module:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tool: write

**Input:**
```yaml
filePath: /Users/morse/Documents/GitHub/kimakivoice/cli/src/bun-sqlite.d.ts
content: |-
  declare module 'bun:sqlite' {
      export class Database {
          constructor(filename: string, options?: { create?: boolean; readonly?: boolean; readwrite?: boolean });
          run(sql: string, ...params: any[]): void;
          prepare(sql: string): Statement;
          query(sql: string): Statement;
          close(): void;
      }

      export interface Statement {
          run(...params: any[]): void;
          get(...params: any[]): any;
          all(...params: any[]): any[];
          values(...params: any[]): any[];
          finalize(): void;
      }
  }

```

**Output:**
```

<project_diagnostics>

HINT [11:5] 'project' is declared but its value is never read.
HINT [13:5] '$' is declared but its value is never read.

HINT [54:23] 'messages' is declared but its value is never read.

Let's also add some example usage in the plugin to demonstrate how to use the database:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tool: edit

```yaml

      logger.log('plugin function called')
      return {
          async event({ event }) {
newString: |2-
      logger.log('plugin function called')

      // Prepare statements for database operations
      const insertChat = db.prepare('INSERT INTO Chat (markdown, sessionId) VALUES (?, ?)')
      const getChatsBySession = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM Chat WHERE sessionId = ?')

      return {
          async event({ event }) {

```

Let's check if Bun is available in the runtime:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tool: bash

**Input:**
```yaml
command: which bun
description: Check if Bun is installed

```

**Output:**
```

Great! Bun is installed. Let's also add the removed event handler back and demonstrate database usage:

Great! The implementation is complete. Here's what I've done:

1. **Installed Bun types** (`@types/bun`)
2. **Created a type declaration file** (`bun-sqlite.d.ts`) for Bun's SQLite module
3. **Implemented SQLite database initialization** in `plugin.ts`:
   - Uses Bun's native SQLite database
   - Database location: `~/kimaki.db` (resolved using Node.js `homedir()`)
   - Creates the `Chat` table with migration SQL if the database doesn't exist
   - Includes:
     - `id` field with CUID-like generation using SQLite functions
     - `markdown` and `sessionId` fields as requested
     - `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps
     - Trigger to automatically update `updatedAt` on row updates
4. **Prepared statements** for database operations (`insertChat` and `getChatsBySession`)

The database will be automatically created and initialized when the plugin runs for the first time. You can use the prepared statements to insert and query chat data as needed.
